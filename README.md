# Fujifilm SPA Android SDK Tutorial
 
## Introduction
This project is a sample application to demonstrate how to integrate with the Fujifilm SPA Android SDK.  
 
This document provides a tutorial to use the Fujifilm SPA Android SDK in your Android application.
 
### What is it?
The Fujifilm Smart Publishing API SDK is a library that you can include in your existing Android application to enable photo product output through Fujifilm.  This provides you with a new revenue stream while providing a new valuable service to your application users.
 
The Fujifilm SPA SDK gives you access to over 50 popular photo gift products and allows you to control the availability and pricing of each product through our web portal. 
 
Please visit the Fujifilm Developer Network portal to sign-up and obtain an API key, set product pricing, and configure your application.  The portal is available at http://www.fujifilmapi.com/.

The Fujifiml Image Picker library, ffimagepicker.aar, provides access to albums and images on the device for selecting images to use with our photo products.

## Requirements
+ App minimum SDK 28 or above
+ Developers using the Fujifilm SPA Android SDK need to sign up for an account on Fujifilm Developer Network (http://fujifilmapi.com), create an application, obtain an API Key, and setup catalog products and pricing.
 
## Integration Instructions
Add a new module 'fujifilm.spa.sdk', add the file fujifilm.spa.sdk and a build.gradle file to this module.
```java build.gradle for 'fujifim.spa.sdk' module
configurations.create("default")
artifacts.add("default", file('fujifilm.spa.sdk.aar'))
```

Add a new module 'ffimagepicker', add the file ffimagepicker.aar and a build.gradle file to this module.
```java build.gradle for 'ffimagepicker' module
configurations.create("default")
artifacts.add("default", file('ffimagepicker.aar'))
```

Add the new modules to your applications's settings.gradle file
```java settings.gradle for your application
include ':fujifilm.spa.sdk'
include ':ffimagepicker'
```

Add the new modules as dependencies in your application's build.gradle file.
```xml build.gradle for your application
dependencies {

    implementation project(path: ':ffimagepicker')
    implementation project(path: ':fujifilm.spa.sdk')

}
```

### Android Manifest - Permissions
Update your app’s `AndroidManifest.xml` to add the following permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>
```

Change your minimum SDK version to 28 or above in your gradle file:

```xml
minSdkVersion 28
```

You can now force Android Studio to sync with your configuration
 
## Implementation Instructions
 
### Fujifilm SPA SDK Usage
 
See complete example [here](#full-example).
 
Import the following classes in your activity:
 
```java
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.FFImage;
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.FujifilmSPA;
 
//Add the following classes, if not already imported
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.widget.Toast;
```
 
Create and store a FujifilmSPA Object using the following code:
 
```java
FujifilmSPA fujifilmSPA = FujifilmSPA.getInstance();
```
 
Call `checkout` and pass in all required parameters to start. This will create a new child application where the checkout process will commence.

```java
fujifilmSPA.checkout(Activity startingActivity, int requestCode, String apiKey, SdkEnvironment environment, String userID, boolean shouldRetainUserInfo, ArrayList<FFImage> images, String promoCode, LaunchPage launchPage, Map<String, Serializable> extraOptions);
```
 
#### Parameters
 
 | Name | Type | Description |
 | ------- | ------| -------------- |
|`startingActivity`|`Activity`|The parent activity that is starting the Fujifilm SPA SDK. This will be used to provide information about the order when the Fujifilm SPA SDK (child app) finishes.  
|`requestCode`|`int`|A user-defined request code to handle response messages. An integer that will be sent back in 'OnActivityResult' when the FujifilmSPASDKActivity finishes  
|`apiKey`|`String`|Fujifilm SPA apiKey you receive when you create your app at http://fujifilmapi.com. This apiKey is environment specific  
|`environment`|`FujifilmSPA.SdkEnvironment`|Sets the environment to use. The apiKey must match your app’s environment set on http://fujifilmapi.com.  
|`userId`|`String`|Optional parameter. This can be used to link a user with an order. May be null if no UserId is desired. MaxLength = 50 alphanumeric characters  
|`shouldRetainUserInfo`|`boolean`|Save user information (address, phone number, email) for when the app is used a 2nd time.  
 |`images`|`ArrayList<FFImage>`|ArrayList of FFImage objects. May be null if no images passed in are desired. FFImage can be a local image (id, path) or public url (https://). Supported image types are jpeg/png. A maximum of 100 images can be sent in a given Checkout process. If more than 100 images are sent, only the first 100 will be processed.  
|`promoCode`|`String`|Optional parameter to add a promo code to the order. May be null if no promo code passed in is desired. Contact us through http://fujifilmapi.com for usage and support.  
|`launchPage`|`FujifilmSPA.LaunchPage`|The page that the SDK should launch when initialized. Valid values are (Home, Cart), defaults to Home  
|`extraOptions`|`Map<String, Serializable>`| A map with several accepted key/value pairs. All key/value pairs are optional; `extraOptions` may be empty or `null` if no options are desired. See section "[Extra Initialization Options](#extra-initialization-options)" for more information.

#### Extra Initialization Options (Optional) 
The following are currently accepted key/value pairs for the `extraOptions` initialization parameter:
 
 | Name | Type | Description |
 | ------- | ------| -------------- |
|`FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_ADD_MORE_PHOTOS_DISABLED`|`boolean`|By default this is set to `false`. To disable the "Add More Photos" feature set this to value `true`. If `false` (or omitted), the user will be able to add more photos from his or her local Photos gallery on the Compose screen and the Prints screen.  
|`FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_LAUNCH_LINK`|`String`|Specifies which page the user is first presented with when launching the SDK. You can send the user to the cart, category, product details, or product builder. To send the user to the cart, set the value to `Cart`. To send the user to a category use the follow pattern: `mailorder/CATEGORY_NAME`. Make sure to change the `CATEGORY_NAME` to the name of the category, for example, `mailorder/WallArt`. To send the user to a product details screen use the following pattern: `mailorder/CATEGORY_NAME/PRODUCT_NAME`. Make sure to change `CATEGORY_NAME` to the name of the category and the `PRODUCT_NAME` to the name of the product, for example, `mailorder/canvas/11x14gallerywrappedcanvas`. To send the user to a product builder screen use the following pattern: `mailorder/CATEGORY_NAME/PRODUCT_NAME/builder`. Make sure to change `CATEGORY_NAME` to the name of the category and the `PRODUCT_NAME` to the name of the product, for example, `mailorder/canvas/11x14gallerywrappedcanvas/builder`.  
|`FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_HAS_PRERENDERED_ITEMS`|`PreRenderedOrder`|See section "[Providing Pre-rendered Products](#providing-pre-rendered-products)" for more information  
|`FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_USE_BROADCAST_PICKER`|`boolean`|By default this is set to `false`. If you would like to use your own image picker set this value to true and follow the instructions in section "[Override Image Picker (Optional)](#override-image-picker-optional)"

#### Override Image Picker (Optional)
If you're interested in having our SDK use your image picker when the user attempts to add more photos to their session, please implement the following steps.
1. Add the FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_USE_BROADCAST_PICKER option to the extraOptions initialization parameter and set the value to true.

        if(overrideFujifilmSDKImagePicker) {
            if (extraOptions == null) {
                extraOptions = new HashMap<>();
            }
            extraOptions.put(FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_USE_BROADCAST_PICKER, true);
        }

2. Register a receiver to handle a broadcast from Fujifilm's SDK. This will be sent when the user attempts to add more photos from the SDK if the extraOption flag (FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_USE_BROADCAST_PICKER) is set to true in step 1. The Intent extra contains an array list of unique identifiers (Strings) that represents the images the user has in session. This should be referenced in your image picker to display to the user which images are already in their session (show the image as selected). The FFImage object has a uniqueidentifier property and can be accessed by calling getUniqueIdentifier, myFFimageObject.getUniqueIdentifier(). You can then use this identifier to compare it to the identifiers for the images in your image picker and display to the user the images already in their session.

         if(overrideFujifilmSDKImagePicker) {
              IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
              filter.addAction(FujifilmSPA.ACTION_ADD_MORE_PHOTOS);
              LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(mAddMorePhotosLocalBroadCastReceiver, filter);
          }
          private BroadcastReceiver mAddMorePhotosLocalBroadCastReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
              @Override
              public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
                  String action = intent.getAction();
                  if (action.equals(FujifilmSPA.ACTION_ADD_MORE_PHOTOS)) {                
                      //ArrayList<String> usedImageIdentifiers = intent.getStringArrayListExtra(FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_ADD_MORE_PHOTOS_USED_IMAGES);
                      showMyOwnImagePicker();
                  }
              }
          };

3. Send a broadcast for Fujifilm's SDK with images from your own image picker using an Intent action of FujifilmSPA.ACTION_DATA_RESPONSE and Intent extra FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_IMAGES_FROM_PICKER with your images as the  

          if(overrideFujifilmSDKImagePicker && hasNewImages) {
              Intent i = new Intent(FujifilmSPA.ACTION_DATA_RESPONSE);
              i.putExtra(FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_IMAGES_FROM_PICKER, images);
              LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(MainActivity.this).sendBroadcast(i);
          }

#### Providing Pre-rendered Products (Optional)
Pre-rendered (custom) products can be used to create your own custom content that we will print on either a 4x8 Greeting card, 5x7 Greeting Card, 5x7 Stationery Card or 8x8 Photo book custom product. Pre-rendered products can only be used with pre-rendered (custom) product codes. You first have to enable the custom product(s) on your pricing page in the portal, which can be found under the Cards > Custom Cards and Photo Books > Custom Photo Books categories in the left navigation. After you enable the custom product(s) you can then use one of the 4 product codes:

    4x8 Greeting Card: "PRGC;823"
    5x7 Greeting Card: "PRGC;830"
    5x7 Stationery Card: "PRGift;4121"
    8x8 Photobook: "PRGift;5212"

In order to include pre-rendered products with your order, you may pass an instance of the `PreRenderedOrder` class into the `extraOptions` parameter. This class contains a list of products (instance of `Line` class) to be added to the order. Each `Line` contains a product code field which corresponds to the product code found on http://fujifilmapi.com, as well as a list of `Page` objects. Each `Page` object contains a list of `Asset` objects, each of which contains an asset type (only "image" is currently accepted) as well as a url to the Hi-Res image to be printed.
The following is an example function showing how to create an order with a pre-rendered Stationery Card:

```java
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.Asset;
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.Line;
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.Page;
import com.fujifilm.libs.spa.PreRenderedOrder;

private PreRenderedOrder createPrerenderedOrderWithStationeryCard() {

    //create an image Asset for the front of the card
    Asset assetFront = new Asset("image", "http://test.com/prerenderedCardFront.jpg");
    Asset[] frontAssets = {assetFront};
    
    //create an image Asset for the back of the card
    Asset assetBack = new Asset("image", "http://test.com/prerenderedCardBack.jpg");
    Asset[] backAssets = {assetBack};
    
    //create a Page for the front of the card. Set the appropriate assets
    Page pageFront = new Page();
    pageFront.setAssets(frontAssets);
    
    //create a Page for the back of the card. Set the appropriate assets
    Page pageBack = new Page();
    pageBack.setAssets(backAssets);
    
    Page[] pages = {pageFront, pageBack};
    
    //create a Line which represents the product
    Line line = new Line();
    
    //set the product code to that of the desired product
    line.setProductCode("PRGift;4121");
    
    //add the front and back pages to the Line
    line.setPages(pages);
    
    Line[] lines = {line};
    
    //Create a new order containing the Line
    PreRenderedOrder preRenderedOrder = new PreRenderedOrder();
    preRenderedOrder.setLines(lines);
    
    return preRenderedOrder;
}
```

#### Finish Fujifilm SPA SDK
 
When the Fujifilm SPA SDK is finished, it will return to the parent app. You can check the result in `onActivityResult()`. The requestCode for the result will be the same as the code that was passed in when the checkout method was called.
 
```java
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)
{
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
 
    if(requestCode == FujifilmSPASDK_INTENT){
        //FujifilmSPASDK_INTENT is the requestCode passed in when checkout was called.
        //If the user successfully completes an order, the resultCode will be RESULT_OK
        if(resultCode == RESULT_OK){
            //user successfully completes an order.
            //Toast.makeText(this.getApplicationContext(),data.getStringExtra(FujifilmS//PA.EXTRA_STATUS), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
        //If the user cancels the order or the SDK fails, the resultCode will be RESULT_CANCELED
        if(resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED){
            //Toast.makeText(this.getApplicationContext(),data.getStringExtra(FujifilmS//PA.EXTRA_STATUS),Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
        if (data.hasExtra(FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_PROMO_ERROR)) {
            //Toast.makeText(this.getApplicationContext(),String.valueOf(data.getSerializableExtra(FujifilmSPA.EXTRA_PROMO_ERROR)), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
        }
 
    }
}
```
 
In the case of a successful purchase, the result code of the response will be `RESULT_OK`. For any other case (either due to a user cancel or an error), the result code will be `RESULT_CANCELED`. If the result is `RESULT_CANCELED`, the `EXTRA_STATUS` field will define the reason for a cancellation. This can be used to check whether the user cancelled the order, or what error caused the SDK to close.
 
The status code will be one of the following values:
 
|`EXTRA_STATUS` | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ |
|0  | Fatal Error         |
|1  | No Images Uploaded  |
|2  | No Internet         |
|3  | Invalid API Key     |
|4  | User Cancelled      |
|5  | No Valid Images     |
|6  | Time Out            |
|7  | Order Complete      |
|8  | Upload Failed       |
|9  | User ID Invalid Format|
|10  | Promo Code Invalid Format|
 
In addition, a promotion code that is in a valid format but is otherwise invalid will still allow the SDK to run. In this case, the intent will include a field `EXTRA_PROMO_ERROR`, which will explain why the promotion is invalid.
Possible values are as follows:
 
| `EXTRA_PROMO_ERROR` | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 0  |Promotion Expired            |
| 1  |Promotion Not Yet Activated  |
| 2  |Invalid Discount             |
| 3  |Promotion Disabled           |
| 4  |Promotion Does Not Exist     |
| 5  |Fatal (default)              |
 
#### Receiving analytic events (Optional)
If you're interested in seeing what behavior your users are taking in our SDK, we provide a way for any you to listen to events from us when users take certain actions. To receive these events, implement an instance of `BroadcastManager` and  register it to receive events with the `FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EVENT_ACTION_FILTER` action. Make sure to register the `LocalBroadcastManager` before starting the SDK and to un-register the handler in `onActivityResult` from the SDK.

Each event attribute will be provided in the received `Intent` with the keys and value types as defined below. Below is an example of how data is received in the broadcast and how to register it.

##### Example Code

Setting up the `BroadcastReceiver` and an example of how to handle the Item Purchased event:

```Java
private BroadcastReceiver mSDKAnalyticsReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String action = intent.getAction();
        if (action.equals(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EVENT_ACTION_FILTER)) {
            handleSDKAnalytics(intent);
        }
    }
};

private void handleSDKAnalytics(Intent intent) {
    String event = intent.getStringExtra(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EVENT);
    if (event == null) {
        return;
    }
    switch (event) {
        case FujifilmSPA.Analytics.ACTION_ITEM_PURCHASED:
            String purchasedProductName = intent.getStringExtra(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EXTRA_PRODUCT_CODE);
            String purchasedProductCode = intent.getStringExtra(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EXTRA_PRODUCT_ID);
            int purchasedQuantity = intent.getIntExtra(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EXTRA_QTY_OF_ITEM_PURCHASED, 0);
            double purchasedUnitPrice = intent.getDoubleExtra(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EXTRA_PRODUCT_UNIT_PRICE, 0);

            Log.d(TAG, "Received Item Purchased event");
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}
```

Just before starting the SDK, register the `BroadcastReceiver` using `LocalBroadcastManager`:

```java

// Call this before calling FujifilmSPA.checkout
private void registerFujifilmSDKAnalyticsReceiver() {
    IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter();
    filter.addAction(FujifilmSPA.Analytics.EVENT_ACTION_FILTER);
    
    LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(mSDKAnalyticsReceiver, filter);
}
```

When the SDK finishes, unregister the `BroadcastReceiver`:

```java
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == SDK_REQUEST_CODE) {
        LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).unregisterReceiver(mSDKAnalyticsReceiver);
        // anything else you want to handle here
    }
}

```

## Additional notes and debugging help
 
The following are some notes to help with integrating with **Fujifilm SPA Android SDK**.
 
### Use Requirements:
+ The phone must have internet access to begin the SDK, and must retain access throughout the checkout process. If the connection is lost during the checkout process, an alert will be shown notifying the user that an internet connection is required.
+ A maximum of 100 images can be sent to the SDK in a given checkout process. If more than 100 images are sent, only the first 100 will be processed.
+ Only jpeg/png files are supported.
+ The maximum size of a single file is 20MB for local images, no file size restriction for public urls
 
### Errors that prevent the SDK from Starting
+ If you get a "Duplicate class android.support..." error update the dependency with the following:
```
dependencies {    
    implementation ('com.fujifilmssd:fujifilm.spa.sdk:1.11.0') {
        exclude group: "com.android.support"
    }
}
```
+ 0 valid images
+ No internet access
+ Invalid APIKey. Ensure the APIKey you are using matches the environment string you are passing in (Stage, Preview, Production)
+ Permissions not granted
 
As these errors prevent the Fujifilm SPA SDK activity from ever being created, `onActivityResult` will not be called. Instead, a Log message will appear in the android console explaining why the SDK was unable to start.
 
### Errors that will cancel the SDK
+ Loss of network or internet access before all images have finished uploading
+ All images fail to upload / no remaining images to checkout with
 
These errors will return control back to the parent app and supply a status code in `onActivityResult`. In addition, depending on the nature of the error, there may be a Log message in the Android console with more information on the cause for the error.
 
### Errors that will prevent a specific picture from uploading or being processed
+ An image is over 20MB
+ An image is of an unsupported file format
Image file is corrupt or is uploaded unsuccessfully, making it corrupt
 
These Errors will not cancel the SDK, and as such, they will not directly return an error result in `onActivityResult`. Instead, they will Log an error with more information about the specific error that caused an image to be removed. If enough images are removed such that 0 images are remaining then the SDK will be terminated.
